"""Garmin agent tool — lets the agent trigger a Garmin data sync.

The agent calls ``sync_garmin_data`` when it detects that the user has a
connected Garmin account and fresh activity / health data would improve its
coaching response.

All garminconnect imports are deferred inside the handler so the library is an
optional dependency.
